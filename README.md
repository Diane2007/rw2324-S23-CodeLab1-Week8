# EGG BOILING SIMULATION

...on its way to become a full egg shop simulation

Right now the game simulates my everyday struggle of boiling eggs because I have an entire family of picky eaters.

Things not working:
1. WHY DOES NEITHER int.Parse NOR TryParse WORK??? This breaks my input field.
2. I failed to display the cooked eggs number with the foreach loop. Need to ask Matt.

TODO list:
1. Figure out the above.
2. Add money system, "sell boiled eggs," and "buy eggs" function (maybe include options like grade-A, pasture-raised, etc).
3. Maybe add UI? Like at least draw your pot and eggs?
